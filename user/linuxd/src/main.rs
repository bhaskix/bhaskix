//! The Linux personality, in ring 3.
//!
//! [RFC 0005](../../../docs/rfc/0005-linux-abi-compatibility.md) §"Where it
//! lives" has required since it was drafted that this run in **a service
//! domain, not the nucleus**, and gives the reason: it is a parser for some
//! three hundred system calls whose pointer and length arguments come from the
//! process being contained, which makes it the largest single piece of attack
//! surface this project will ever have. In a domain, a bug in it costs that
//! domain's authority. In the nucleus, it is a kernel bug.
//!
//! Steps 2 to 8 built it in the nucleus anyway. This program is where that is
//! corrected, and it is corrected **one call at a time** rather than in one
//! move: every call the kernel still answers keeps working exactly as it did,
//! and the boundary report says how many are left.
//!
//! # How a call gets here
//!
//! A hosted thread traps. The kernel decides — from one relaxed load — that
//! the domain speaks a foreign dialect, and tries the handlers it still has.
//! **What none of them answers is sent here**, as an ordinary IPC call made by
//! the hosted thread itself, which blocks until this program replies. So the
//! kernel needs no list of what this program handles: as calls move out of the
//! kernel they simply stop being answered there and start arriving here.
//!
//! The Linux call number arrives as the message's `method`, its first four
//! arguments as the message's four words, and the *badge* says which hosted
//! domain is asking — stamped by the kernel from the capability actually used,
//! never by anything the caller supplied.
//!
//! # What it holds
//!
//! A console to report through, and the endpoint it serves on. That is all,
//! and it is the point: this program has no filesystem, no device, and no way
//! to obtain either. When it grows a hosted process's files and sockets it
//! will hold *those* capabilities, and a bug in it will reach exactly them.
